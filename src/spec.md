# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the resume site’s Experience and Technical Projects content by adding two new entries, removing duplicated information between sections, and fixing the desktop projects card layout for a clean, aligned presentation.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new Experience entry titled “Programming & Front-End Development (Self-Learner)” to the resume content and render it using the existing Experience card structure (title/company/period/location + bullet list).
- Add a new Technical Project titled “Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)” with “Medical Billing & Corporate Case” included in its description/subtitle, including the provided workflow bullets, tools badges, and focus tags.
- Deduplicate repeated facts/tools between Experience and Technical Projects so key details (e.g., “22 U.S. practices” and tool lists) appear once in the most appropriate section without losing meaning.
- Update the Technical Projects section layout so desktop widths show a 2-column grid (2+ projects), while mobile remains single-column, with consistent spacing/alignment and no horizontal overflow.
- Ensure spacing, typography hierarchy, and card alignment in Experience and Technical Projects match the existing professional nature/healthcare-appropriate theme and interactions.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the new self-learning Experience entry and the new RCM Technical Project without repeated information across sections, and Technical Projects display as two neatly aligned cards per row on desktop (single-column on mobile).
