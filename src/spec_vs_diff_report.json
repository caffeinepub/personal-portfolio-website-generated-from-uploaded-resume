  "summary": "Frontend resume button was updated to point to a presumed backend download route and keep loading/unavailable states, but no backend implementation or seeding of the PDF is shown in the diff. Additionally, the frontend sets a different downloaded filename than requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Store the resume PDF in the Motoko backend (stable state) and expose an HTTP download route that returns the PDF with appropriate headers so the browser downloads it as a file.",
      "reason": "The diff contains no backend Motoko changes (no backend/main.mo updates) implementing stable storage of the PDF or an http_request route returning application/pdf with Content-Disposition attachment, nor a non-200 response when unset.",
      "evidence": [
        "MODIFIED FILES list contains only frontend/src/components/portfolio/ResumeDownloadButton.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json"

      "requirement": "Seed the backend with the current resume PDF named \"Hamza-Ali-Arshad-Resume-20251211-(1).pdf\" so it is available immediately after deployment without manual upload steps.",

      "requirement": "Update the frontend \"Download Resume\" button to download the resume from the backend download route while keeping existing disabled/loading behavior; served filename matches the specified PDF name via Content-Disposition.",
      "reason": "The button points to a backend-like route and retains loading/unavailable UI, but the anchor sets download=\"Hamza-Ali-Arshad-Resume.pdf\", which does not match the required filename \"Hamza-Ali-Arshad-Resume-20251211-(1).pdf\" and may override the backend-provided filename.",
