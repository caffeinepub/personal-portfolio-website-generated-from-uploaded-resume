However, there is insufficient direct diff evidence that the Technical Projects section layout was updated to a 2-column desktop grid (REQ-4) or that ProjectsSection typography/spacing alignment was addressed (REQ-5). Some unrequested UI changes were added to Experience cards (e.g., “Current Role” badge, 2-column grid for Experience).",

      "reason": "The provided diff summary does not include the contents of `frontend/src/components/portfolio/ProjectsSection.tsx`, so there is no direct evidence in the shown changes that the Technical Projects cards were converted to a 2-column desktop grid or that overflow/scroll issues were addressed.",
